During blogging's peak, I had lots of time to write and maintain my own web space.  Life moved on, as did I, and maintaining an archive of who I was in 2003 no longer seemed worth the trouble.  I do other things now.\r\n\r\nI might choose to write again sometime, and it's possible I'd do so here. But the best places to find me for now are:\r\n\r\n* Twitter [@joshcvt](http://twitter.com/joshcvt/) is for off-the-cuff talk and pressure venting, more sports than not. If locked down, I'll probably approve a follow request if I recognize you.\r\n* Goodreads [joshcvt](http://goodreads.com/joshcvt/) gets reads and reviews since fall 2014, and some back content as well.</li>\r\n* GitHub [@joshcvt](http://github.com/joshcvt/) is where I work on some dev projects I don't mind open-sourcing.  The current highlight is [natinal](http://github.com/joshcvt/natinal), a Python monitoring system for MLB.com live data feeds.  And of course, this site is itself hosted as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site.\r\n\r\nThe substantive way to reach me is by <a href=\"mailto:behindthenet@gmail.com\">email</a>.\r\n\r\nThanks for visiting.",

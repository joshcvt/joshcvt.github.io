        <p>This domain once hosted the blog of Josh Crockett, 아빠, DevOps/software engineer, musician, runner, Virginia Tech alumnus, Charlottesville, Virginia resident, and guy who watches a lot of sports.</p>

<p>I'm still around, but the site, not so much.  Life moved on, as did I, and maintaining an archive of who I was in 2003 no longer seemed worth the trouble.  I do other things now, and thankfully I've learned a little bit since then.</p>

<p>I still write on occasion:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/03/06/bryce-harper-should-have-legacy-washington-why-cant-i-find-it/?utm_term=.f7ed8c3a96ba">Bryce Harper should have a legacy in Washington. Why can't I find it?</a> -- my March 2019 piece in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">WashingtonPost.com</a>'s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-sports-bog/">DC Sports Bog</a> after the Nationals' slugger left for Philadelphia. Little did we know that his legacy would materialize within months, as the Nats' retooled roster claimed the franchise's first World Series championship.</li>
    <li><a href="vaumcAdvocate2015-12p6.pdf">What goes with orange? Reflections of a Hokie in "C-ville"</a>: my essay after rotating off the board of the Wesley Foundation at the University of Virginia in summer 2015, originally published in the Foundation alumni newsletter and picked up later that year by the Virginia United Methodist Advocate, the official journal of the Virginia Conference of the United Methodist Church.</li>
    <li><a href="theFeel.html">The Feel</a>: poetry isn't usually my thing, but an early-2020 reminiscence on a pickup hockey goal I scored years ago (back when Charlottesville had a rink) seemed to call for it.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Otherwise, perhaps you'd be interested in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GitHub <a href="http://github.com/joshcvt/">@joshcvt</a> for dev projects I don't mind open-sourcing, mostly fooling around with open sports APIs or fixing minor operational hassles like getting podcasts to my older Garmin watch. </li>
  <li>Goodreads <a href="http://goodreads.com/joshcvt/">joshcvt</a> for books I read and occasionally review.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/343197039">Me at Athlinks</a>: the best (if incomplete) results aggregator I've found for the (mostly 5K/10K) races I run.</li>
</ul>

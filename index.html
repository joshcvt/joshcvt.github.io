        <p>This domain once hosted the blog of Josh C., 아빠, software developer, Virginia Tech alumnus and Carolina Hurricanes/Washington Nationals/Brighton & Hove Albion fan in Charlottesville, VA.</p>

<p>I'm still around, but the site, not so much.  Life moved on, as did I, and maintaining an archive of who I was in 2003 no longer seemed worth the trouble.  I do other things now.</p>

<p>I still write on occasion, and <a

  doesn't find its way onto WashingtonPost.com</a>, it might end up here. Otherwise, if you're just stumbling onto this site and don't know me personally, 
  perhaps you'd be interested in:</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Goodreads <a href="http://goodreads.com/joshcvt/">joshcvt</a> for books I read and occasionally review.</li>
<li>GitHub <a href="http://github.com/joshcvt/">@joshcvt</a> for dev projects I don't mind open-sourcing, mostly fooling around with open sports APIs. </li>
</ul>

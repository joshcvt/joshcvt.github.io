<h1>BehindTheNet.org</h1>

<p>This domain once hosted the blog of Josh C., software developer, Virginia Tech alumnus and Carolina Hurricanes/Washington Nationals fan in Charlottesville, VA.</p>

<p>I'm still around, but the site, not so much.  During blogging's peak, I had lots of time to write and maintain my own web space.  Life moved on, as did I.  Maintaining the archive as self-hosted blogging software required regular security updates, then third-party hosting services failed or shut down, became more trouble than it was worth.  And I'm not the same person as I was in 2003 with all the same opinions that I had then.</p>

<p>I might choose to write again sometime, and it's possible I'd do so here. But the best places to find me for now are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/joshcvt/">@joshcvt</a> is for off-the-cuff talk and pressure venting, more sports than not. If locked down, I'll probably approve a follow request if I recognize you.</li>
<li>Goodreads <a href="http://goodreads.com/joshcvt/">joshcvt</a> gets reads and reviews since fall 2014, and some back content as well.</li>
<li>GitHub <a href="http://github.com/joshcvt/">joshcvt</a> is where I work on some dev projects I don't mind open-sourcing.  The current highlight is <a href="http://github.com/joshcvt/natinal">natinal</a>, a Python monitoring system for MLB.com live data feeds.  And of course, this site is itself hosted as <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> site.</li>
</ul>

<p>The substantive way to reach me is by <a href="mailto:behindthenet@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting.</p>
